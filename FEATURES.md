# Must-haves
- scrobble with listenbrainz api
- import from maloja
- import from spotify
- natively host on subdirectory
- good mobile ui
- replace artist/album/track art from ui
- fetch artist/album/track art from lastfm and/or spotify
- edit artist/album/track name in ui (auto-merge colliding names)
- built with being exposed to the internet in mind
- track artist aliases
- hold a cache of musicbrainz responses, with a button to clear it out
# Want
- use musibrainz ids from scrobble to automatically merge plays
- use musicbrainz ids from scrobble to automatically add AKA fields (美波 aka Minami) and sort name
- export playlist m3u8 files based on charts
- track device/player listened from
- webhooks on certain events (every scrobble, listening milestones, etc.)
- Time of day, day of week, etc. graphs
- "pause" mode that temporarily disables recieving scrobbles until turned back on
# Stretch
- "Listening Digest" wrapped-esque digestable recap of the last week/month/year
# Could explore
- Federation/ActivityPub
